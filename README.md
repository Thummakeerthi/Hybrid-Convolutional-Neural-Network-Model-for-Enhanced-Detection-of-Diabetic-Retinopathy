# Hybrid-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Model-for-Enhanced-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes-induced eye disease that can lead to permanent vision loss if not diagnosed early. To improve detection accuracy, this study proposes a Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model combining the strengths of multiple CNN architectures.
