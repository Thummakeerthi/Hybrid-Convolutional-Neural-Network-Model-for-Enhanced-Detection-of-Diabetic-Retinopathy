1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Diabetic Retinopathy Classification
3. Image processing
	- using ImageDataGenerator 
		- Re-scaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image 
	
	
4. Building the model 
    - ResNet50
    - InceptionV3
    - InceptionV3 and ResNet50 Combination with CNN
    - DenseNet201
    - Xception
5. Training the model
6. Building the model 


Flask Framework
----------------
 
7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Upload an image for analysis
10. The given input is preprocessed 
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result
12. Final Outcome is display

Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the DR Dataset like ResNet50, InceptionV3 and Combination of IR with CNN  96% of accuracy, 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other techniques such as DenseNet and Xception for analysis Dataset, in which may get 97% of accuracy or above,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
